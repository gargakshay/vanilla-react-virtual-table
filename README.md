# vanilla-react-virtual-table

[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/gargakshay/vanilla-react-virtual-table)

* Implemented a virtualized table.
* Set the default row count to 500 and the column count to 26.
* Implemented infinite scrolling to dynamically load more data as the user scrolls.
* Ensured that the table header remains fixed for a consistent user interface.
* Bound the table data with a JSON structure.
* To view the data, users can click on the "Output" button in the console CTA.
